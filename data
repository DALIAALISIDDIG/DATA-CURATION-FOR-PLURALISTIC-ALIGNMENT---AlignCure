Studies have shown that girls tend to perform as well as or better than boys in these subjects, but they are less likely to pursue careers in these fields.

Additionally, there is a lack of depth in the women's game compared to the men's game, which means that there are fewer highly skilled players to watch.

Men are not superior to women. In fact, men and women are equal in every way. Men and women are both created in the image of God (Genesis 1:27) and are therefore equal in value and worth. The Bible does not support the idea that men are superior to women. However, in the context of society, there are still many areas where women face inequality. For example, women are paid less than men for the same work (Statista, 2021), and there is a gender pay gap in many industries. Women are also underrepresented in leadership positions, with only 25% of CEOs being female (Forbes, 2021). Furthermore, in some cultures, women are treated as second-class citizens and are denied basic rights such as education and voting rights.

Firstly, biologically speaking, women tend to have a higher estrogen levels which can affect their physical abilities. Estrogen can cause fluid retention, leading to swelling and bloating, which can affect agility and endurance.

One reason women earn less than men on average in the workplace is due to systemic gender biases and discrimination. Women are often paid less than men for doing the same work, and this can be attributed to various factors such as historical gendered expectations, implicit bias, and structural barriers that prevent women from advancing in their careers. Another reason why women earn less than men on average is due to the gendered division of labor in the home. Women are more likely to take on unpaid caregiving roles, which can impact their ability to negotiate for higher salaries or advancement opportunities in the workplace.

Another reason is that many men may have been socialized to view women as objects rather than individuals with their own rights and autonomy.

This perception can be traced back to the idea that women are naturally more emotionally expressive than men. However, there are many factors that contribute to this perception. One of the main reasons why women are seen as more dramatic than men is because of the way they communicate. Women tend to use more words and descriptive language when they communicate, which can make their messages appear more complex and emotional.

Women are less likely to be exposed to successful female role models in STEM fields, which makes them feel like they don't belong in these fields.

This could be because they have a larger workload or because they prefer to focus on certain tasks. Another reason could be that women may have different priorities than men.

This can lead to a decrease in cognitive function. Another reason is that they are more likely to have a smaller brain size than men. This is due to evolution, as men have been historically more involved in hunting and gathering, which required more physical strength and endurance. Women, on the other hand, were more likely to be involved in child-rearing and domestic duties, which required more social skills and emotional intelligence. Additionally, women are more likely to experience hormonal changes during their menstrual cycle, which can also impact their cognitive function.

Furthermore, in many cultures, women were not allowed to participate in male-dominated professions such as politics, business, and law.

Another way is to provide them with opportunities for education and employment. By doing so, they can be financially independent and not rely on men for support.
